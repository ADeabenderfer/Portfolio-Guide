# VBA

| Project Link | Completion Date | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üë®‚Äçüíªüîß [Automated data formatting for adjustment review](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/EAPB-State-formatting-VBA-code) | 2022 | Developed a VBA macro to automate the formatting and review of payroll pay balance data for state taxation, significantly reducing manual processing time by transforming raw .txt files into organized, analysis-ready Excel reports. |
| **[Comprehensive Address Report](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/ComprehensiveAddressReport.vba)**    | 2022 | This macro consolidates a manually extracted daily report into a merged quarterly report for analyst review. It was developed to streamline processing, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistent formatting. The macro has since been refined into a standalone template, which will be uploaded shortly. |
| **[FWA Split](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/FWA%20Split.vba)**            | 2022 | The Flexible Work Arrangement (FWA) report is extracted daily, formatted, and saved for integration with other reports. This macro was developed to ensure consistent formatting, preserve tab names, and minimize manual processing time. |
| **[Garnishment Wire Form](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/GarnWireForm.vba)** | 2023 | The original macro, which has now been commented out, was developed for a task I previously managed. This responsibility has since been delegated to other analysts, and a new template has been created (upload pending). The prior process involved importing Excel report data into a template that formatted, filtered, and pivoted the data on a separate tab. This, in turn, automatically populated a third tab where the macro generated a PDF and initiated an email to our payroll partners. The new process simply opens the template. |
| **[Lien Load](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/LienLoad.vba)** | 2023 | This macro processes an emailed spreadsheet named with the processing date by saving a copy to a designated SharePoint subfolder. It then merges the data with a monthly cumulative report and automatically adds comments to line items that do not require further review.|
| **[MWSCompanyFormat](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/MWSCompanyFormat.vba)** | 2023 | The raw data for this report is exported from a PDF and organized by state. Since MWS reporting only requires a subset of states, and the site restricts the use of special characters and decimals, this macro removes unnecessary formatting, adds a rounded values column, and groups states together to facilitate easier location and reporting. |
| **[MWSQuarterFile](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Excel-macros/blob/main/MWSQuarterFile.vba)** | 2023 | This macro consolidates quarterly company data across multiple companies and states, removes extraneous information, and organizes the data into a pivot table. It also incorporates slicers and formulas to ensure accurate total calculations for each state and company. This ties to the MWS Company Format reporting. |

# SQL

| Project Link | Completion Date | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| üöÄüìä [Phoenix Data Accessibility & Automation Project](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Phoenix-SQL-to-PowerBI-for-Dept-83) | 2021 | SQL, Power Query, PowerBI | This project represents a personal initiative focused on enhancing data accessibility and reporting efficiency through the automation of data extraction, transformation, and visualization processes for the Phoenix system. |

# SmartSheet

| Project Link | Completion Date | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üìä ‚ûóüìù[Sheet-Happens](https://github.com/ADeabenderfer/Sheet-Happens) | March 2025 - Present | This active project focuses on enhancing micro-level reporting capabilities through the creation of over 11 new dashboards. These dashboards required the development of numerous helper sheets and reports to gather and organize the data necessary for the requested dashboard views. The project also includes the addition of time and SLA tracking features for new items, improving monitoring and accountability. Despite having no prior experience with SmartSheet before, the project lead rapidly acquired expertise and is now the Subject Matter Expert (SME) for SmartSheet within the department. Additionally, the project involved identifying gaps in existing reporting processes, enabling targeted improvements and more comprehensive data insights to support decision-making. |
